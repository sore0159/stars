About:
    Stars creates a simple, relaxing star field in a browser using javascript and a html5 2D canvas.
To Install:
    Download index.html and stars.js, then load index.html in a web browser.
Notes:
    Tested on a 11' macbook air, so performance might be a problem on larger screens/slower computers.
